Files included -
1. camera_setup.hpp
2. color.hpp
3. framebuffer.hpp
4. objects.hpp
5. vector.hpp
6. scene.cpp (main source file)
7. Makefile (use this for compiling and generating executable)

Instructions (For the ray tracer portion):
Use the makefile to compile the code and create the executable. The default name is my_raytracer.
When running the executable my_raytracer, also give the .scene file as an input argument. If you do not give the .scene parameter the code will just prompt to give input argument next time you run and will exit the current run.
So please run the following commands -

1) make -f Makefile
2) ./my_raytracer my_scene.scene
